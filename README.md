===========

I'm using this repo to teach my friend some Java, libgdx, and shell stuff!

To compile, first create `bin` and `libs` directories at the root of the project. Then, download and unzip [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/releases/libgdx-0.9.9.zip) and place the following jars into `libs`:
* gdx.jar
* gdx-natives.jar
* gdx-backend-lwjgl.jar
* gdx-backend-lwjgl-natives.jar

Then just run `deploy.sh` (or the commands found within `build.sh` and `run.sh`).
